Architectural classification of homes based on images.

Preprocessing is done in the ```Preprocess.ipynb``` notebook.  All model training is done in the ```Train Model.ipynb``` notebook in the notebook directory.  Finally, ```Visualize Model.ipynb``` explores some of the model structure, as well as performance on out of sample images (mainly grabbed from Google Maps).
